description: What is product management? A brief, opinionated, overview of the field
---
Product management is the art and science of planning, developing,
and launching products that successfully meet customer needs and generate business value. 

It involves: 
* identifying market opportunities, 
* defining product requirements, 
* working with cross-functional teams to design and develop the product, 
* managing the product lifecycle, and 
* continuously monitoring and improving the product 
to ensure it meets customer expectations and drives growth for the business. 

Product Managers do not build the product. Instead they determine what product needs to be built in order to maximize the market opportunity for the business. 

### Why does product management matter?

Product management matters for a number of reasons. Here are some key benefits of using product management practices:  

1. Increased efficiency and productivity: Product management helps to ensure that product development is focused on meeting customer needs and delivering value, rather than simply building features. This can help streamline the product development process, reduce waste, and increase overall efficiency and productivity.

2. Improved customer satisfaction: By understanding and validating customer needs, product managers can create products that are better suited to their customers' needs and preferences. This can lead to higher levels of customer satisfaction and greater long-term loyalty.

3. Enhanced market competitive advantage: Product management practices help organizations stay ahead of the competition by identifying emerging trends and opportunities, developing innovative products, and positioning them effectively in the marketplace.

4. Better resource allocation: Product management helps organizations allocate resources more effectively by prioritizing product development efforts based on customer needs and market potential. This can help ensure that resources are invested in projects that will have the greatest impact.

5. Improved team collaboration: Product management practices promote cross-functional collaboration across different teams within an organization, including product management, marketing, sales, and customer support. This helps to align everyone around a common set of goals and objectives, and ensures that all stakeholders are working together effectively.

Overall, product management is essential for any organization looking to develop successful products and drive business growth. By adopting best practices in product management, organizations can improve efficiency, enhance customer satisfaction, gain a competitive advantage, allocate resources more effectively, and foster better team collaboration.
