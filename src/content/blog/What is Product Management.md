description: What is product management? A brief, opinionated, overview of the field
---

Product management, in a nutshell, is the art and science of planning, developing,
and launching products that successfully meet customer needs and generate business value. 

Product Managers must build the product; paradoxically, only some managers manage people directly. Instead, PMs manage the entire product lifecycle, from determining what product to make to maximize the market opportunity for the business to ensuring that the product meets the market needs and solves an essential problem for users.

What Product Managers Do:
* identify market opportunities, 
* defining product requirements, 
* Work with cross-functional teams to design and develop the product, 
* Manage the product lifecycle, and 
* Monitor and improve the product to ensure it meets customer expectations and drives growth for the business.

### Product Management is not Project Management

Project Management is a distinct field with unique requirements and success criteria. 
* Project Managers are tasked with coordinating across teams and resources to execute projects successfully under time and budget constraints. 
* Project management involves planning, organizing, and overseeing the execution of a project from start to finish. It encompasses tasks such as defining project goals, creating schedules, allocating resources, managing budgets, and ensuring the project meets its objectives within the specified time frame.

Product managers focus on determining what to build next and ensuring the right product. Project Managers focus on executing clearly defined projects on time and budget.

### Why does product management matter?

Product Management, when done right, is a force multiplier and allows cross-functional teams to create massive leverage by effectively organizing across disciplines, levels, and roles to gain alignment around a compelling vision and high-impact roadmap. Without product managers, work still gets done, and products still get built; it's just that they are less likely to hit their mark or have the same impact without clear product leadership to guide the team toward a successful outcome.

Product management matters for several reasons.

1. **Clarity and Focus lead to Increased efficiency and productivity:** Product management helps ensure product development is focused on meeting customer needs and delivering value rather than simply building features. Clarity and focus can help streamline product development, reduce waste, and increase efficiency and productivity.

2. **Customer insights Enhanced market competitive advantage:** Product management practices help organizations stay ahead by identifying emerging trends and opportunities, developing innovative products, and positioning them effectively in the marketplace.

4. **Better targeted products lead to Improved customer satisfaction:** By understanding and validating customer needs, product managers can create products better suited to their customers' needs and preferences. User-centric design and UX can increase customer satisfaction and long-term loyalty.

5. **Systematic Prioritization leads to Better resource allocation:** Product management helps organizations allocate resources more effectively by prioritizing product development efforts based on customer needs and market potential. Prioritization can help ensure that resources are invested in projects with the most significant impact.

6. **Effective Communication channels Improve team collaboration:** Product management practices promote cross-functional collaboration across different teams within an organization, including product management, marketing, sales, and customer support. Effective communication helps align everyone around a standard set of goals and objectives and ensures all stakeholders work together effectively.

Whether or not there is a formal title of Product Manager, Head of Product, or founder, someone in the organization needs to own this function. Every company in every industry operating today that seeks competitive advantage will need a technology-enabled product strategy. 

In this blog series, I introduce you to the concept of Product-Led Growth, and I will argue why I believe a Product-Led Growth strategy is the most likely strategy to achieve outsized business outcomes. We will examine PLG and compare it to other Go-to-Market strategies to help you understand why it is so special.

In later articles, I plan to cover topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning as these emerging technologies, coupled with a product-led growth strategy, could provide unique opportunities to solve problems for your users in never-cable ways.
