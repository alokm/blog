This blog covers topics related to the art and science of product management. Product Management is the practice of creating successful products. My goal is to share with you the current best practices for managing the creation of successful products while also covering the creative aspects, instincts, and insights from my experience and other experts in the field.

Product Management, often called Product for short, is focused on identifying customer needs and creating products that meet those needs while delivering business value. Because product success is often multi-dimensional, product management is a multidisciplinary field combining elements of marketing, design, engineering, and business strategy. 

This blog will explore the various aspects of product management and how they can be applied to create successful products. We will delve into market research, customer development, business strategy, product development, pricing, and distribution (aka Go-to-Market strategy.)

Along the way, I will share my insights and experiences with other experienced product managers and industry experts. This blog aims to help clarify the role of product management while helping anyone interested to become better at the craft.
