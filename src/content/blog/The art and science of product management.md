# Welcome to the art and science of product management

**Disclaimer** This** is my personal writing and all thoughts are my own.

This blog covers topics related to the art and science of product management. Product Management, simply put, is the practice of creating successful products. My goal is to share with you the current best practices for managing the creation of successful products while also covering the creative aspects, instincts and insights from my experience as well as other experts in the field.

Product, as the role is often called, is focused on identifying customer needs and creating products that meet those needs while delivering business value. Because success for products is often multi-dimensional in nature, product management is necessarily a multidisciplinary field that combines elements of marketing, design, engineering, and business strategy. 

This blog will explore the various aspects of product management and how they can be applied to create successful products. We will delve into topics such as market research, customer development, business strategy, product development, pricing, and distribution (aka Go-to-Market strategy.)

Along the way I will share share my own insights and experiences as well as those of other experienced product managers and industry experts. The goal of this blog is to help clarify the role of product management while helping anyone with an interest to become better at the craft.
